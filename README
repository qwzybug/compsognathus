Hey, everyone likes probabilistic drum machines!

My friend Greg showed me this, for example:
http://www.urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/2009/02/ruby_arduino_controlling_the_a.html

The idea is, you don't actually program a drum machine, you program a program
to program a drum machine. Actually it's easier.

To make this work:
git clone git://github.com/qwzybug/compsognathus.git
cd compsognathus
git clone git://github.com/gilesbowkett/archaeopteryx.git
git clone git://github.com/qwzybug/templarx.git

Now you'll want to wire up some kind of MIDI wizardry. I don't totally
understand why this is necessary, but here's an easy video about it:

Then open compsognathus.rb in Shoes. Party time, right?

There are some good demo probability files in the archaeopteryx repository.
db_drum_definition.rb is a nice one to start with. Better copy it before you
tinker, though.

It's really not done yet. If you can make it better please do. Especially, the
keyboard widget doesn't let you hit just a black key. (How can I stop Shoes
mouse events from bubbling?) Also, you can't save a blank file in OS X, I
think.

What else should go in a README...?
